# Playstation App Clone

This Flutter project was developed during my Erasmus studies in Romania in 2023 as part of the Mobile Techniques on the Mobile Platform course at UAIC. The goal was to create a mobile application using Flutter and Dart that emulates the functionality of the official PlayStation app. A demonstration video showcasing the app's features is available.

## Screens

### Play Screen
The Play Screen serves as the app's home screen, displaying the user's profile icon and the last three games played. Each game is represented with its name, picture, and a breakdown of earned trophies, showing both overall progress and individual trophy counts.

### Messages Screen
The Messages Screen organizes user chat groups, allowing seamless access to conversations where users can send and receive messages. Messages are color-coded based on sender and are sorted chronologically.

### Friends Screen
The Friends Screen categorizes the user's friends into online and offline lists, providing a convenient way to browse and interact with friends.

### Explore Screen
The Explore Screen features the latest official news and PlayStation (PS) blog stories, offering users clickable links to full articles for more details.

### PS Store Screen
The PS Store Screen integrates an InAppWebView to display the official PlayStation Store webpage, enabling users to freely navigate and explore available content.

### Game Library Screen
The Game Library Screen presents two distinct lists: played games and purchased games. Games are showcased with card layouts featuring game images. Users can sort lists alphabetically (A-Z, Z-A) or by purchase date.

### Search Screen
The Search Screen allows users to search for specific game titles and player usernames, enhancing accessibility and user experience.
